# note-to-become-devops
My personal notes for myself to look up later whenever I run into server-related tasks. It's mostly about AWS, Linux (Ubuntu) and other devops technologies.

## [Mongodb and Redis server script]()
It contains script to update system, install MongoDB and Redis, common Ubuntu kernel tweaks for them.
Require: 2 additional attached storage devices for data and log. They are should be separated because of different I/O behaviours.

## [Ubuntu script for Ruby (Rails) app]()
## [Explaination of some Linux limits configuration](https://github.com/tranvictor/note-to-become-devops/tree/master/linux_limits_configuration)
